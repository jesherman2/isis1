<td style="width: 274px; height: 24px;">ISIS needs to be demolished, they are killing innocent Americans everyday. Therefore we should be able to kill people that try to approach our shoulders with bombs strapped on their chest.</td>
<td style="width: 295.5px; height: 24px;">&nbsp;ISIS is a very dangerous group that does not care if it kills innocent people. The U.S army would never kill innocent people and it would be hard to have troops on the ground with all the innocent people.</td>

<tr style="height: 24px;">
<td style="width: 274px; height: 24px;">&nbsp;If America wanted to take an easier approach they could have troops on the ground figure out where some of their headquarters are. Then they could drop MOABS on them killing ISIS members and not innocent people.</td>
<td style="width: 295.5px; height: 24px;">&nbsp;ISIS hides suicide bombers to look like everyday people, the U.S troops can't fire on them, therefore it is hard to put troops on the ground.</td>

<h1><span style="color: #00ccff;">My Opinion</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I believe that America should go in and exterminate ISIS. This would be hard without losing a couple of U.S. soldiers, but in the long run it would benefit a lot because then we wouldn't have ISIS killing innocent U.S. civilians everyday. Also I believe that President Trump should put a ban of Middle East from coming to are country to be safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
